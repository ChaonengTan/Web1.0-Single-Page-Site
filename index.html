                    <li>My view and opinions on Peanut Butter: If peanut butter is to wear the word-pants, then it only follows that its texture should be dominant. Girth. Body. Volume. Stature. If a sandwitch be solved mathematically, bread is soft, jelly is squishy, and peanut butter is the variable. The given is that a sandwitch should achieve textual equilibrium. As such the only choice for peanut butter is crunchy!</li>
                    <li>The following are examples of crunchy peanut butter from more established brands. My favorite/ also my family's go-to brand is Skippy for its exeptional crunchyness starting off the day off on the right foot. </li>

                    <li>Jif is an American brand of peanut butter made by The J.M. Smucker Company, which purchased the brand from Procter & Gamble in 2001.[1] In 1955, Procter & Gamble bought Big Top peanut butter from William T. Young of Kentucky and, in the ensuing years, reformulated and rebranded it to compete with Skippy and Peter Pan. P. & G. named its product Jif, used oils other than peanut oil in its hydrogenation process, and sweetened the recipe, adding sugar and molasses. The original Creamy and Crunchy style Jif peanut butters both debuted in 1958. In 1974, Extra Crunchy Jif was introduced, followed in 1991 by Simply Jif, a peanut butter variant with low sodium and less sugar than regular Jif. Reduced Fat Jif was introduced three years later in 1994.[2] In 2014, Jif Whips was released as the first whipped peanut butter.</li>

                    <li>Skippy is a brand of peanut butter manufactured in the United States and China. First sold in 1932,[1] Skippy is currently manufactured by Hormel Foods,[2] which bought the brand from Unilever in 2013.[3] It is the best selling brand of peanut butter in China and second only to the J.M. Smucker Company's Jif brand worldwide.[4]</li>
                    <li>Percy Crosby, creator of the popular "Skippy" comic strip (1923-1945), which had been adapted into the 1929 novel Skippy, the daytime, children's radio serial Skippy (1932-1935), and the Oscar-winning 1931 film Skippy, had trademarked the name "Skippy" in 1925. When in 1932 the Alameda, California, food packer Joseph L. Rosefield began to sell its newly developed hydrogenated peanut butter, which it labeled "Skippy" without permission,[5] Crosby successfully had the trademark invalidated in 1934. Rosefield persisted using the name and after Crosby was committed to an asylum and after the passage in 1946 of the Lanham Act, Rosefield was granted rights to the trademark.[6]</li>
